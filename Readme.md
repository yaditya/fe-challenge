## Front End Technical Test

### Overview

You'll find attached a simple JSON file. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to read the JSON file and display it in as per the attached design file.

Let us know how long you spend on the challenge and please don't spend more than an evening on it. 

Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

Thanks and good luck!
